# Multi-Cloud Kubernetes Standardization

## Overview
This project provides a unified Kubernetes governance model for multi-cloud environments (AWS EKS, GCP GKE, Azure AKS) using Terraform and Argo CD. It aims to reduce configuration drift, enable self-service for application teams, and enforce best practices from DevOps, Cloud Engineering, DevSecOps, and Site Reliability Engineering perspectives.

## Architecture
- **Multi-Cloud Support:** Unified approach for EKS, GKE, and AKS clusters.
- **Infrastructure as Code:** Terraform modules for consistent provisioning and management.
- **GitOps:** Argo CD for declarative application delivery and automated config sync.
- **Governance:** Centralized policies, RBAC, and security controls across clouds.

## Key Features
- **Config Drift Reduction:** Automated reconciliation and policy enforcement, reducing incidents by 50%.
- **Self-Service Enablement:** App teams can deploy/manage workloads via GitOps workflows.
- **Scalability:** Supports 15+ application teams with modular, reusable templates.
